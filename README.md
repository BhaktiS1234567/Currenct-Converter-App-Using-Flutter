Currency Converter Application Using Flutter:

The Currency Converter App is a simple, user-friendly Flutter application designed for real-time currency conversions using up-to-date exchange rates fetched from reliable APIs like OpenExchangeRates or ExchangeRate-API. It features dropdown menus for selecting base and target currencies, an input field for entering the amount to convert, and a responsive layout to ensure compatibility across devices. The app's conversion logic multiplies the input amount by the fetched exchange rate, instantly displaying the result.

Built using Flutter and Dart, the app leverages the HTTP package for API calls and state management tools like setState. Its design is customizable, allowing for easy addition of supported currencies or changes in themes and layouts. The app provides a clean, adaptive user interface that ensures seamless interaction and usability for all users.
